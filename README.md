- Aggregated datasets by day into commuter trip counts (5am-9am) and other (total trips - (commuter trip counts x 2))
- Appended all trip dataset into one master
- Added daily weather info
- Added bike shop counts (# of bike shops within approx 2 miles) for each of the 8 bike trip counter locations
