Study of bike trips in Seattle 2014 - 2020

Data cleaning
- Obtained datasets of hourly bike trip counts from 8 different Seattle bike trip counter datasets (some with extra pedestrian trip data included)
- Aggregated datasets by day for each counter location and summerized trip counts by am peak (5-9 am: assumed to be commuter trips) and other trips (an estimate of non-commuter trips: total trips - (commuter trip counts x 2))
- Added bike shop counts (# of bike shops within approx 2 miles) for each of the 8 bike trip counter locations
- Merged all trip datasets by date into one master
- Added daily weather info
- Created total am peak trips and other trips, am peak trips for counter locations with 3 or less bike shops nearby and other trips for counter locations with more than 3
